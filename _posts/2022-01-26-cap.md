It is for distributed databases. And says that we can have only two out of three gurantees.

* C(Consistency): every node returns same recent data
* A(Availibility): every request gets response
* P(Partition tolerance): system functions despite of partition/network failure

**Options**:

* CA: rdbms
* CP: single master or active/passive master, distributed database. ex:hbase
* AP: muti master, distributed database. ex:cassandara, cosmosdb

**Note**: In distributed systems we deal with multiple machine so we would require partition tolerance so the only thing we have to choose is either consistency/availibilty.

### CP

In this case we can recevice timeout from the application as availibilty will not be guranteed.


### AP

In this case request receives newest version of data available as consistency will not be guranteed.
