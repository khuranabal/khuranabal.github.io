It is for dimension tables where changes are less in source rdbms which we want to get into datawarehouse or hdfs


### Type of SCD

#### SCD Type 1

History is not maintained, data is overwritten.


#### SCD Type 2

Maintain history. It can be done in below three ways, lets take emaple of product data. All products are stored in products table then:

  * **version**: maintain multiple version (increasing int value) of same product latest version is the latest details of the product

  * **flag**: keep flag representing latest details of the product

  * **effective date**: maintain start date and end date, this way we can keep track of the product details over period of time.
