### module 

it is just a python file which may hold functions, classes, methods, variables. for import we can use `import` as show below.

```py
import sys #to import full module
from datetime import date #to import submodule
from time import time #to import specific function, it can then be called directly
```

**Note**: functions are not bound to any class whereas methods are bound to class


### global variable

```py
print(__name__) #output: __main__
#if we have another module (different python file) to print __name__ variable
#import the other module in main python file 
#then the other module will print __module__ and main will print __main__
```

one way to use it:

```py
if __name__ == "__main__":
  print("invoked when directly called")
else:
  print("invoked when imported as module in other file")
```


### dymanic typed

It is dynamically typed language, means data types are inferred.

```py
var = 1
print(var)
```


### lambda functions

inline function, example for square we can use like below

```py
x = lambda a : a * a
print(x(2))
```
