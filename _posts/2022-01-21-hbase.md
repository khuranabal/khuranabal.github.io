### rdbms properties

* structured
* random access
* low latency
* ACID
  * Atomic: full transaction either completes or fail
  * Consistency: updates should not violate constraints
  * Isolation: multiple concurrent sessions can work on database in some sequence using locking
  * Durability: data is stored and recoverable even after failure


### limitations of hadoop

* unstructured data
* no random access
* high latency
* no ACID compliance


### bigtable/hbase

bigtable paper is published by google, it is distributed storage system for structured data. hbase is implementation of the same.

hbase is distributed database management system on top of hadoop. So is:
  * distributed
  * scalable
  * fault tolerant


#### hbase properties

* loose structured: as each row can can different number of columns
* low latency: uses row keys to fetch data
* random access: uses row keys to fetch data
* somewhat ACID: as it provides ACID at row level only, not if multiple rows are updated

It provides batch processing using mapreduce and real time processing using row keys.


### storage in hbase

It stores data in columnar format as shown below.

**Advantages**:

  * sparse data: In case there is no data for some of the columns then those columns will be skipped while storing
  * dynamic attributes: can have data with more or less columns


### hbase vs rdbms

rdbms                                 | hbase
data is arranged in rows and columns  | data is in columnar format
sql                                   | nosql
supports groupping, joins, etc        | supports only CRUD
normalized data to reduce redundancy  | denaormalized (self contained) to reduce disk seek
ACID compliant                        | ACID compliant at row level


**Note**: 

* all data is stored in byte array in form of bytes in hbase, there is no concept of data types in it
* row keys are stored in sorted asc order, so as binary search can be done to find value
* column families are fix and defined when creating table
* columns can be more or less
