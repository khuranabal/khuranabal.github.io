hadoop offers:
* hdfs: for storage
* mapreduce: for computation
* yarn: for resource management

spark is general purpose in memory compute engine, so its an alternative to mapreduce in hadoop, but would require storage (local/cloud) and resource manager(yarn/mesos/k8s).

spark can run on top of hadoop by replacing mapreduce with spark

### why spark

problem with mapreduce, it has to read and write from storage every time for each mapreduce job. And spark does all the processing in memory, so ideally just initial one read and final write to disk would be required. it is approximately 10-100% faster than hadoop.


### what do we mean by spark is general purpose

in hadoop we use:
* sqoop: for import
* pig: for cleaning
* hive: for querying
* mahout: for ML
* storm: for streaming

whereas in spark we can do all like cleaning, querying, ML, ingestion, streaming.


### storage unit in spark (rdd)

basic unit which holds data in spark is rdd (resilient distributed dataset). It is in memory distributed collection

```
//transfornations (lazy), nothing is executed only dag is being formed
rdd1 = load file1 from hdfs
rdd2 = rdd1.map

//action, it will be executed along with required transormations
rdd2.collect
```

lets say we have 500MB file in hdfs, then default we have 4 blocks data, based on 128MB block size. So, these 4 blocks will be loaded in memory as rdd in 4 partitions.

**resilient**: can recover from failure, if we loose rdd2 then through lineage graph its known how the rdd was created from its parent rdd. So, rdd provide fault tolerance through lineage graph. whereas in haddop resiliency is maintened by replication in hdfs.

**lineage graph**: keeps track of transormations to be executed after action has been called.

**immutable**: after rdd load data cannot be changed

### why immutable

because if we keep only one rdd and modify the same again and again, then in case of rdd failure at some step then we wont have parent rdd to regenrate then would require to do all the transformation from start.

### why lazy transformations

so as optimized plan can be made.

example: in below case we have to load all data then show one line only, it is better to optimize the plan knowing what all transormations are needed.
```
rdd1 = load data
rdd1 take 1 record to print
```
