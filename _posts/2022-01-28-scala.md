spark code can be written in different languages: scala, python, java, r

### why scala

* scala gives best performance as directly scala code can work in jvm, no seperate process required. However in python, a process intreacts with jvm, so an extra layer. In java, bulky code.
* whenever new release happen it is avaialble in scala first then in other languages
* spark is also written in scala


### scala basics

#### val & var

val: constant, cannot be changed once declared
`val a: Int = 2`

var: variable, can be changed
`var a: Int = 2`

**type inference**: if data type is not mentioned then scala will infer data type
`var a = 2`

#### data types

Int     | 4 bytes
String  | sequence of chars
Boolean | true/false
Char    | 2 byte
Double  | 8 bytes
Float   | 4 bytes
Long    | 8 bytes
Byte    | 1 byte

**Note**: 
* after the value, have to give f in float and l in long
* concat is done using `+` can even do with mixed data types


#### interpolation

**s interpolation (string interpolation)**:

```scala
val name:String = "abc"
println(s"hello $name") //output: 'hello abc'
```

**f interpolation**:

```scala
val v:Float = 3.145
println(f"value is $v%.2f") //output: value is 3.14
```

**raw interpolation**:

```scala
println("value is \n 10") //it will give new line
println(raw"value is \n 10") //it will give as is text with \n in print
```

### collections

Array
val a = Array(1,2,3,4)
println(a.mkString(","))

for (i <- a) println(i)

start from index 0
array is muttable
searching on index is fast
adding new element is inefficient
it is val but still array can be changed if we try to assign new Array then it will not allow

List
val b = List(1,2,3,4)
println(b.head) //it will give 1
println(b.tail) //it will give everything other then head, List(2,3,4) 
for (i <- b) println(i)

b.reverse

holds element in singly linked list, searching is not effecient but adding a new element at start of list is effecient.
ex: 
10 :: b will add 10 in start of list


Tuple
val c = ("abc",1000,true)
println(c._1) // this will retrun the first element

can treat like record in table
can have diff data type
it start with index 1
if tuple has only 2 element then it can treated as key value pair

Range
val r = 1 to 10 // this gives including 10 we can also use until to exculde the last vaule
for (i <- r) println(i)

Set
hold only distinct vaules
order is not maintained
val s = Set(1,1,2,2,2,3,4) // it will save only distinct values un ordered
min, max, sum like functions can be used on it


Note: only array is muttable others are immuttable in collections
Array, List, Tuple order is maintained

Map
val m = Map(1 -> "abc", 2 -> "def")
m.get(2)

collection of key value pair
with key can search vaule
hold unique key only if repeating the latest one will be used


scala
its hybrib (oops + functional)

why scala

functional
scripting way, concise code

ways to write code:
REPL: do directly in scala terminal, to view result intractively
IDE: clispase, vs code etc.

functional:
supports pure functions and immutable values
natural fit for library design and data crunching thats why spark libraries are written in scala

function: relates input to output like maths sqrt

### pure function

input determines output: ex: dollar to rs conversion func accespts only dollar then it has to be depndent on some conversion if not passed then its impue func
function does not change input vaule: ex: input to func if changed in the function then impure
no side effects: ex: if println used in func then impure, need to check more on it

if all three properties satisfy then func is pure

easy way to check if func is pure:
referential transparency- if replacing the func with vaule do not impact result. ex: sqrt(4) where called can be replaced with 2

### first class function
a.
whatever we can do with values in traditional languages, same should be able to do with func, treat function like values.
ex: val a: Int = 1

def sample(i: Int): Int = {
  i * 2
}

val a = sample(_)

a(5) // this should return 10

b.
should be able to pass func as param to func
def func(i: Int): Int = { i * 3 }

def func2(i: Int, f:Int => Int) = {
  f(i)
}

c.
return func from func
def func = {
  x: Int => x*x
}

Note: by default all func are first class in scala

### higher order func
func which either takes func as input param or returns another func as output

ex: map function

map: if n input rows then we get n output rows
ex- 
var a = 1 to 10

def sample(i: Int): {i * 2}

a.map(sample) # this will double all the rows

### anonymous func
without name func
ex-

same previous example can be done by
var a = 1 to 10
a.map(x => x * 2)
// similar to lambda in python
mostly used with higher order func as shown in ex map

### immutability
val is prffered over var because of immutability

### loop vs recursion vs tail recursion
find factorial using loop:
def factorial(i: Int): Int = {
  var result: Int = 1
  for(i <- 1 to i)
  {
    result = result * 1
  }
}
here we are mutating result and i, in scala val are preffered over var

find factorial using recursion:
def factorial(i: Int): Int = {
  if (i == 1) 1
  else i * factorial(input - 1)
}

this solves problem for mutating but it takes memory to capture all entries until terminating condition reached. for large calculation it might go for out of memory

find factorial using tail recursion:
def factorial(i: Int, result: Int): Int = {
  if (i == 1) result
  else factorial(input - 1, result*input)
}

in this only the last statment is hold in memory as required data is only in last statement.

### statement vs expression
each line of code is statement
expression is line of code that returns something
In scala we only have expression no statements, so every line of code returns something

### closure

in functional programming a func can returna func
in oops we can return an object

object has data elements like variables and functions in it, so in functional we have only function, how to get data elements.
thanks where we use closure, in function it can have local variable which will be used thats called closure?


### Type system

Any

AnyVal:

Byte
Short
Int
Long
Float
Double

Unit: example println return this
Boolean
Char

AnyRef

List
Seq
Tuple

String


Null: is valid for only AnyRef
Nothing: 


### operator

there is no operator in scala only methods

1 + 2

here + is method, it is short of a.+(b) can be done as a + b
we can see all methods available by a.tab


### placeholder syntax

val a = 1 to 100
a.map((x:Int) => x * 2)

here always we have one input param then we can remove it and replace with placeholder syntax

a.map(_ * 2)

### partially applied functions
this is an act of creating brand new functins by fixing one or more parameters ina func

ex:
def func1(x: Double, y: Double) = {x/y}
func1(10,3)
val inverse = func1(1, _: Double)
inverse(10)


ex:
def sum(x: Int, y: Int, f: Int => Int) = {
  f(x) + f(y)
}

sum(2,3,x=>x*x)
sum(2,3,x=>x*x*x)

val sum_of_squares = sum(_:Int, _Int, x=>x*x)
sum_of_sqaues(2,2)

### function currying
syntactic sugar, similar to partially applied function

def sum(f:Int => Int)(x:Int, y:Int) = {
  f(x) + f(y)
}

val sum_of_sqaues = sum(x=>x*x)_
sum(2,2)
