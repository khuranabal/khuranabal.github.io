spark code can be written in different languages (scala, python, java, r), scala is hybrib, oops + functional.

ways to write code:
* REPL: do directly in scala terminal, to view result intractively
* IDE: eclipse, vs code etc.


### why scala

* scala gives best performance as directly scala code can work in jvm, no seperate process required. However in python, a process intreacts with jvm, so an extra layer. In java, bulky code.
* whenever new release happen it is avaialble in scala first then in other languages
* spark is also written in scala
* scripting way, concise code
* functional, supports pure functions and immutable values. Natural fit for library design and data crunching thats why spark libraries are written in scala

**Note:** function relates input to output like maths sqrt

### scala basics

#### val & var

val: constant, cannot be changed once declared
`val a: Int = 2`

var: variable, can be changed
`var a: Int = 2`

**type inference**: if data type is not mentioned then scala will infer data type
`var a = 2`

#### data types

Int     | 4 bytes
String  | sequence of chars
Boolean | true/false
Char    | 2 byte
Double  | 8 bytes
Float   | 4 bytes
Long    | 8 bytes
Byte    | 1 byte

**Note**: 
* after the value, have to give f in float and l in long
* concat is done using `+` can even do with mixed data types


#### interpolation

**s interpolation (string interpolation)**:

```scala
val name:String = "abc"
println(s"hello $name") //output: 'hello abc'
```

**f interpolation**:

```scala
val v:Float = 3.145
println(f"value is $v%.2f") //output: value is 3.14
```

**raw interpolation**:

```scala
println("value is \n 10") //it will give new line
println(raw"value is \n 10") //it will give as is text with \n in print
```

**Note**: in a block of code last statement is the return statement


### conditional

#### if else

```scala
if (1>2) println("hi") else println("ih")
```

#### match

it is like switch
```scala
vall n = 1
n match {
  case 1 => println("1")
  case 2 => println("2")
  case 3 => println("3")
  case _ => println("in else")
}
```

### loop

#### for loop

```scala
for (x <- 1 to 10) {
  val i = x*2
  println(i)
}
```

#### while loop

```scala
var i = 0
while (i <= 10) {
  println(i)
  i = i + 2
}
```

#### do while loop

```scala
var i = 0
do {
  println(i)
  i = i + 2
} while (i <= 10)
```


### collections 

#### array

* start from index 0
* array is muttable
* searching on index is fast
* adding new element is inefficient
* it is val but still values in array can be changed, if we try to assign new array then it will not allow

```scala
val a = Array(1,2,3,4)
println(a.mkString(","))

for (i <- a) println(i)
```

#### list

* holds element in singly linked list
* searching is not effecient
* adding new element at start is effecient
* lot of system defined functions are available to use in the list

```scala
val b = List(1,2,3,4)
println(b.head) //it will give 1
println(b.tail) //it will give everything other then head, List(2,3,4) 
for (i <- b) println(i)

b.reverse
```

* adding a new element at start of list is effecient.
ex: 
`10 :: b //will add 10 in start of list`

#### tuple

* can treat like record in table
* can have diff data type
* it start with index 1
* if tuple has only 2 element then it can treated as key value pair

```scala
val c = ("abc",1000,true)
println(c._1) // this will retrun the first element
```

#### range

range of values

```scala
val r = 1 to 10 // this gives including 10 we can also use until to exculde the last vaule
for (i <- r) println(i)
```

#### set

* hold only distinct vaules
* order is not maintained

```scala
val s = Set(1,1,2,2,2,3,4) // it will save only distinct values un ordered
min, max, sum like functions can be used on it
```

#### map

* collection of key value pair
* with key can search value
* hold unique key only if repeating the latest one will be used

```scala
val m = Map(1 -> "abc", 2 -> "def")
m.get(2)
```

**Note**
* only array is muttable others are immuttable in collections
* Array, List, Tuple order is maintained


### pure function

if all three below properties satisfy then function is pure

* input determines output. ex: dollar to rs conversion function accepts only dollar then it has to be depndent on some conversion if not passed then its impure function.
* function does not change input vaule. ex: input to function if changed in the function then its impure
* no side effects. ex: if println used in function then impure

easy way to check if function is pure: referential transparency- if replacing the function with vaule do not impact result. ex: sqrt(4) where called can be replaced with 2


### first class function

a. whatever we can do with values in traditional languages, same should be able to do with function, treat function like values.

```scala
val a: Int = 1

def sample(i: Int): Int = {
  i * 2
}

val a = sample(_)

a(5) // this should return 10
```

b. should be able to pass function as param to function

```scala
def func(i: Int): Int = { i * 3 }

def func2(i: Int, f:Int => Int) = {
  f(i)
}
```

c. return function from function

```scala
def func = {
  x: Int => x*x
}
```

Note: by default all function are first class in scala

### higher order func

function which either takes function as input parameter or returns another function as output

ex: map function

map: if n input rows then we get n output rows

```scala
var a = 1 to 10

def sample(i: Int): {i * 2}

a.map(sample) # this will double all the rows
```


### anonymous function

without name function, same previous example can be done by below. mostly used with higher order func as shown in example map

```scala
var a = 1 to 10
a.map(x => x * 2)
// similar to lambda in python
```

**Note**: val is preffered over var because of immutability


### loop vs recursion vs tail recursion

**find factorial using loop**

```scala
def factorial(i: Int): Int = {
  var result: Int = 1
  for(i <- 1 to i)
  {
    result = result * 1
  }
}
//here we are mutating result and i, in scala val are preffered over var
```

**find factorial using recursion**

```scala
def factorial(i: Int): Int = {
  if (i == 1) 1
  else i * factorial(input - 1)
}

//this solves problem for mutating but it takes memory to capture all entries until terminating condition reached. for large calculation it might go for out of memory
```

**find factorial using tail recursion**

```scala
def factorial(i: Int, result: Int): Int = {
  if (i == 1) result
  else factorial(input - 1, result*input)
}

//in this only the last statment is hold in memory as required data is only in last statement.
```

### statement vs expression

* each line of code is statement
* expression is line of code that returns something
* in scala we only have expression no statements, so every line of code returns something

### closure

* in functional programming a function can return a function
* in oops we can return an object

object has data elements like variables and functions, in functional we have only functions. so how to get data elements, thats where we use closure, in function it can have local variable which can be used thats called closure.

### Type system

Any

AnyVal:

Byte
Short
Int
Long
Float
Double

Unit: example println return this
Boolean
Char

AnyRef

List
Seq
Tuple

String


Null: is valid for only AnyRef
Nothing: 


### operator

there is no operator in scala only methods

1 + 2

here + is method, it is short of a.+(b) can be done as a + b
we can see all methods available by a.tab


### placeholder syntax

val a = 1 to 100
a.map((x:Int) => x * 2)

here always we have one input param then we can remove it and replace with placeholder syntax

a.map(_ * 2)

### partially applied functions
this is an act of creating brand new functins by fixing one or more parameters ina func

ex:
def func1(x: Double, y: Double) = {x/y}
func1(10,3)
val inverse = func1(1, _: Double)
inverse(10)


ex:
def sum(x: Int, y: Int, f: Int => Int) = {
  f(x) + f(y)
}

sum(2,3,x=>x*x)
sum(2,3,x=>x*x*x)

val sum_of_squares = sum(_:Int, _Int, x=>x*x)
sum_of_sqaues(2,2)

### function currying
syntactic sugar, similar to partially applied function

def sum(f:Int => Int)(x:Int, y:Int) = {
  f(x) + f(y)
}

val sum_of_sqaues = sum(x=>x*x)_
sum(2,2)
